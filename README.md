# Distributed_system
Implements a distributed file system in C using UNIX sockets and forked processes. Clients interact via S1, which routes files to S2–S4 based on type. Features upload, download, delete, tarball creation, and file listing through a custom client interface.
This implements a distributed file‐system prototype in C, using UNIX sockets and forked processes to support multiple concurrent clients. The S1 server serves as the single entry point and transparently routes file uploads—storing .c files locally while forwarding .pdf, .txt, and .zip files to S2, S3, and S4, respectively. The accompanying w25clients.c program offers a simple command interface  that lets users upload, download, delete, bundle, and list files without needing to know about the back-end servers. This project showcases socket-based inter-machine communication, background file transfers, directory management, and tarball creation in a multi-process, distributed environment.
